Documentation for MetaCache mode "build"

SYNOPSIS
    metacache build <database name> <reference sequence> OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
    Create a new database of reference sequences (usually genomic sequences).

    You can also provide names of directories that contain
    genomic sequence files instead of single filenames. MetaCache will
    search at most 10 levels down in the file hierarchy.

BASIC OPTIONS
    -verbose              show detailed status information during build

    -silent               don't show any information during the build

    -taxonomy <path>      directory with taxonomic hierarchy data 
                          (see NCBI's taxonomic data files)

    -taxpostmap <file>    file with sequence to taxon id mappings that is used
                          as alternative source in a post processing step
                          default: 'nucl_(gb|wgs|est|gss).accession2taxid'

SAMPLING OPTIONS
    -kmerlen <no>         number of letters in a k-mer
                          default: 16

    -sketchlen <no>       number of features (k-mer hashes) per sampling window
                          default: 16

    -winlen <no>          number of letters in each sampling window
                          default: 128

    -winstride <no>       distance between window start positions
                          default: 113

ADVANCED OPTIONS
    -max-locations-per-feature
            maximum number of target locations to be stored per feature
            This should not be too high in order to not impact querying speed.
            Note that an upper hard limit is always imposed by the data type
            used for the hash table bucket size.
            default: maximum allowed by data type widths
            
    -remove-overpopulated-features
            Removes all features that have reached the maximum allowed amount of 
            locations per feature. This can improve querying speed and can
            be used to remove non-discriminative features.
            default: off

    -remove-ambig-features <rank>
            Removes all features that have more than "-max-ambig-per-feature" 
            many targets on the given taxonomic rank. This can decrease the
            database size significantly at the cost of a small loss in
            sensitivity. Note that the lower the given taxonomic rank is, the
            more pronounced the effect will be.
            default: off

    -max-ambig-per-feature <number>
            Maximum number of allowed different target taxa per feature 
            if option "-remove-ambig-features" is used.

    -max-load-fac <factor>        
            maximum hash table load factor 
            This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption for speed 
            and vice versa. A lower load factor will improve speed, a larger one
            will improve memory efficiency.
            default: 0.8

EXAMPLES
    Build database 'mydb' from sequence file 'genomes.fna':
        ./metacache build mydb genomes.fna

    Build database with latest complete genomes from the NCBI RefSeq
        ./download-ncbi-genomes refseq/bacteria myfolder
        ./download-ncbi-genomes refseq/viruses myfolder
        ./download-ncbi-taxonomy myfolder
        ./metacache build myRefseq myfolder -taxonomy myfolder

    Build database 'mydb' from two sequence files:
        ./metacache build mydb mrsa.fna ecoli.fna

    Build database 'myBacteria' from folder containing sequence files:
        ./metacache build myBacteria all_bacteria
