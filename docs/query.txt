Documentation for MetaCache mode "query"

SYNOPSIS
    metacache query <database name> [<query sequence>...] OPTIONS

DESCRIPTION
    Map sequences (short reads) to their most likely origin.

    You can also provide names of directories that contain
    sequence files instead of single filenames. MetaCache will
    search at most 10 levels down in the file hierarchy.

    If no input sequence filenames or directories are given, MetaCache will
    run in interactive query mode. This can be used to load the database into
    memory only once and then query it multiple times with different
    query options.

BASIC OPTIONS
    -out <file>        Redirect output to file <file>.
                       If not specified, output will be written to stdout.
                       If more than one input file was given all output
                       will be concatenated into one file.

    -splitout <file>   Generate output and statistics for each input file
                       separately. For each input file <in> an output file 
                       <file>_<in> will be written.

    -pairfiles         Interleave paired-end reads from two consecutive files,
                       so that the nth read from file m and the nth read
                       from file m+1 will be treated as a pair.
                       If more than two files are provided, their names
                       will be sorted before processing. Thus, the order
                       defined by the filenames determines the pairing not
                       the order in which they were given in the command line.

    -pairseq           Two consecutive sequences (1+2, 3+4, ...) from each file
                       will be treated as paired-end reads.

    -insertsize        Maximum insert size to consider.
                       default: sum of lengths of the individual reads

    -lowest  <rank>    Do not classify on ranks below <rank>.
                       default: sequence

    -highest <rank>    Do not classify on ranks above <rank>.
                       default: domain

    -hitmin <t>        Sets classification threshhold to <t>.
                       A read will not be classified if less than t features
                       from the database are found in it.
                       Higher values will increase precision at the expense of
                       lower sensitivity.

    -max-cand <no>     maximum number of reference taxon candidates to 
                       consider for each query; A large value can significantly 
                       decrease the querying speed!
                       default: 2

OUTPUT FORMATTING OPTIONS

    -nomap             Don't report classification for each individual query
                       sequence; show summaries only (useful for quick tests).
                       default: off (= print per-read mappings)

    -mapped-only       Don't list unclassified queries.
                       default: off (= print all mappings)

    -taxids            Print taxon ids in addition to taxon names.
                       default: off

    -taxids-only       Print taxon ids instead of taxon names.
                       default: off

    -omit-ranks        Don't print taxon ranks.
                       default: off (= do print taxon ranks)

    -separate-cols     Prints *all* mapping information (rank, taxon name, taxon ids)
                       in separate columns (see option "-separator").
                       default: off (= print rank:taxon_name in one column)

    -separator <text>  string that separates output fields (sequence name, 
                       classification result, etc.)
                       default: "\t|\t"

    -queryids          Show a unique id for each query.
                       Note that in paired-end mode a query is a pair of two 
                       read sequences. This option will always be activated if 
                       "-hits-per-seq" is given.
                       default: off

    -locations         Show locations in classification candidate reference 
                       sequences.
                       default: off 

    -lineage           Report complete lineage for per-read classification
                       starting with the lowest rank found or allowed and
                       ending with the highest rank allowed. See also
                       options '-lowest' and '-highest'.
                       default: off

    -no-query-params   don't show query settings at the beginning of the
                       mapping output
                       default: do show query settings

    -no-summary        don't show result summary & mapping statistics at the
                       end of the mapping output
                       default: do show the summary

ADVANCED ANALYSIS OPTIONS

    -tophits           For each query, print top feature hits in database.
                       default: off

    -allhits           For each query, print all feature hits in database.
                       default: off

    -hits-per-seq      Shows a list of all hits for each reference sequence.
     [<filename>]      If this condensed list is all you need, you should
                       deactive the per-read mapping output with "-nomap".
                       If a valid filename is given after '-hits-per-seq',
                       the list will be written to a separate file.
                       This will activate "-queryids" and set the lowest 
                       classification rank to "sequence".
                       default:off
    
    -abundances        Show absolute and relative abundance of each taxon.
     [<filename>]      If a valid filename is given after '-abundances',
                       the list will be written to a separate file.
                       default:off

    -abundance-per     Show absolute and relative abundances for each
    <rank>             taxon on one specific rank.
                       Classifications on higher ranks will be estimated by 
                       distributing them down according to the relative 
                       abundances of classifications on or below the given rank.
                       If '-abundances <file>' was given, this list will
                       be printed to the same file.
                       default:off

ADVANCED OPTIONS 

    -threads <no>      use <no> many parallel threads
                       default: automatic

    -batch-size <no>   process <no> many reads per thread;
                       This can be used for performance tuning.
                       default: automatic 
    
    -query-limit <no>  Classify at max. <no> reads per file.
                       This can be used for quick tests.
                       default: off

    -winlen <no>       number of letters in each sampling window
                       default: same as for reference sequences in database

    -winstride <no>    distance between window starting positions
                       default: same as for reference sequences in database

    -sketchlen <no>    number of features per window
                       default: same as in database

    -ground-truth      Report correct query taxa if known.
                       Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                       their header or a sequence id that is also present in
                       the database.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -precision         Report precision & sensitivity
                       by comparing query taxa (ground truth) and mapped taxa.
                       Queries need to have either a 'taxid|<number>' entry in
                       their header or a sequence id that is also found in
                       the database.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -taxon-coverage    Also report true/false positives and true/false negatives.
                       This option will turn on '-precision'.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off

    -align             Show semi-global alignment for best candidate target.
                       Original files of reference sequences must be available.
                       This will decrease querying speed!
                       default: off
    
    -max-load-fac <f>  maximum hash table load factor 
                       This can be used to trade off larger memory consumption
                       for speed and vice versa. A lower load factor will
                       improve speed, a larger one will improve memory
                       efficiency. 
                       default: 0.8

EXAMPLES
    Query all sequences in 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq myreads.fna -out results.txt

    Query all sequences in multiple files against database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq reads1.fna reads2.fna reads3.fna

    Query all sequence files in folder 'test' againgst database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq test

    Query multiple files and folder contents against database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq file1.fna folder1 file2.fna file3.fna folder2

    Perform a precision test and show all ranks for each classification result:
        ./metacache query refseq reads.fna -precision -allranks -out results.txt

    Load database in interactive query mode, then query multiple read batches
        ./metacache query refseq
        reads1.fa reads2.fa -pairfiles -insertsize 400
        reads3.fa -pairseq -insertsize 300
        reads4.fa -lineage

OUTPUT FORMAT
    MetaCache's default read mapping output format is: 
    read_header | rank:taxon_name

    This will not be changed in the future to avoid breaking anyone's
    pipelines. Command line options won't change in the near future for the
    same reason. The following table shows some of the possible mapping
    layouts with their associated command line arguments:

    read mapping layout                      command line arguments           
    ---------------------------------------  ---------------------------------
    read_header | taxon_id                       -taxids-only -omit-ranks         
    read_header | taxon_name                     -omit-ranks                      
    read_header | taxon_name(taxon_id)           -taxids -omit-ranks              
    read_header | taxon_name | taxon_id          -taxids -omit-ranks -separate-cols
    read_header | rank:taxon_id                  -taxids-only                     
    read_header | rank:taxon_name                                                    
    read_header | rank:taxon_name(taxon_id)      -taxids                          
    read_header | rank | taxon_id                -taxids-only -separate-cols      
    read_header | rank | taxon_name              -separate-cols                   
    read_header | rank | taxon_name | taxon_id   -taxids -separate-cols           

    Note that the separator "<tab>|<tab>" can be changed to something else with
    the command line option "-separator <text>".

    Note that the default lowest taxon rank is "sequence". Sequence-level taxon
    ids have negative numbers in order to not interfere with NCBI taxon ids.
    Each reference sequence is added as its own taxon below the
    lowest known NCBI taxon for that sequence. If you do not want to classify
    at sequence-level, you can set a higher rank as lowest classification rank
    with the "-lowest" command line option: "-lowest species" or
    "-lowest subspecies" or "-lowest genus", etc.
