You need to specify one of the following modes:
    help        shows documentation 
    query       classify read sequences using pre-built database
    build       build new database from reference sequences (usually genomes)
    add         add reference sequences and/or taxonomy to existing database
    info        show database and reference sequence properties
    merge       merge classification results of independent queries
    annotate    annotate sequences with taxonomic information 

EXAMPLES:
    Query single FASTA file 'myreads.fna' against pre-built database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq myreads.fna -out results.txt
        with output to the console:
        ./metacache query refseq myreads.fna

    Query all sequence files in folder 'test' againgst database 'refseq':
        ./metacache query refseq test -out results.txt

    Query paired-end reads in separate files:
        ./metacache query refseq reads1.fa reads2.fa -pairfiles -out results.txt

    Query paired-end reads in one file (a1,a2,b1,b2,...):
        ./metacache query refseq paired_reads.fa -pairseq -out results.txt
